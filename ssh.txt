Connect your PC with the UR with a UTP cable (on the bottom of the controller).
verify the robotsâ€™ IP adress (generally 192.168.0.1).
ping 192.168.0.1

use the following line to transfer files to the UR:
pscp C:\Users\woute\Desktop\SMR\Demo3v1.8.script root@192.168.0.1:/programs/

Next it will ask for a password which is: easybot

Of course use the correct file location on your own PC. You can also make your own folder on the UR and transfer to/from there.

To transfer files from the UR:

pscp root@192.168.0.1:/programs/Demo3v1.8.script C:\Users\woute\Desktop\
